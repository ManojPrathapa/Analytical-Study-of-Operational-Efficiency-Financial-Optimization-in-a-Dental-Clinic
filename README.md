# Data-Driven Analytical Study of Operational Efficiency & Financial Optimization in a Dental Clinic

This project presents a data-driven business decision modeling (BDM) study focused on **Aadya Family Dental Center**, a private B2C dental practice in Hyderabad. The goal is to identify operational inefficiencies, uncover financial insights, and recommend strategies for improving profitability and patient load management.

## 📌 Project Overview

Conducted a detailed analysis of 6-month operational and financial data including procedure-wise revenue, appointment slot usage, and resource allocation.
Leveraged descriptive statistics, Pareto analysis, and observation-based assessment to uncover actionable patterns in clinic performance.
Provided structured recommendations for AI-based scheduling, pricing strategies, and utilization optimization.

---

## 📂 Data Collection

The project utilized two primary sources of data:

- **Service Revenue and Utilization Data:** Includes treatment types, per-procedure income, and frequency across different time blocks.
- **Observation & Interview-Based Data:** Derived from direct interaction with the clinic and patients to assess resource bottlenecks, congestion periods, and service delivery gaps.

---

## 🧮 Analysis Methods

Several methods and tools were applied:

- **Pareto Analysis:** To identify high-revenue procedures that contribute the most to the clinic's income.
- **Time Slot Utilization Review:** To detect underutilized time periods and suggest rebalancing strategies.
- **Qualitative Interviews & Observations:** To validate congestion patterns, patient behavior, and staff workflow.

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- High-value procedures such as Full Mouth Surgery, Zirconium Crowns, and Fixed Orthodontic Appliances make up the bulk of revenue.
- Peak congestion occurs from 4 PM – 8 PM; morning hours remain underutilized.
- Bufferless scheduling leads to appointment overruns and long patient wait times.
- External dependency on reporting services contributes significantly to overhead costs.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- Implement **AI-based dynamic slot allocation** to manage congestion and reduce waiting times.
- Offer **discounted rates for morning appointments** to drive demand during low-traffic periods.
- Introduce **bundled service packages** combining basic and high-margin treatments.
- Reduce outsourcing by internalizing reporting and basic analytics processes.
